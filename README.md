### Introduction
What is Terraform?
Terraform was developed by Hashicorp. It is a configuration orchestration tool that is incredible for provisioning, adjusting and destroying the virtual server environments. It is available both as a DevOps-as-a-Service enterprise-grade from Hashicorp and as an open-source solution, which allows you to work with a variety of Cloud Service Providers to create multi-cloud ecosystems.

Go to Hashicorp terraform website and download terraform that matches your operating system. 
In my case, I am using windows on a 64bit CPU, once downloaded extract the file and move it to a location you can find it later. Personally, I moved it to "C:/Terraform" so it is easy to remember. 

Afterwards, open your start menu and type, "env" for "edit system environment variable" window and open that. |
Select " Environment Variable" 
Under system variables select "Path", Edit, and include your new terraform directory.

Once that is done, go to Command Prompt and you can verify it is installed with the command, "terraform -v".

Verified we have terraform installed on windows.

### Writing Terraform Code, Main.tf
```provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "resource_group" {
    name = "rg-terraform-demo"
    location = "eastus"
}

# Create a Storage Account
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_account" {
    name = "terraform-azure-houston-4"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.resource_group.name
    location = azurerm_resource_group.resource_group.location
    account_tier ="Standard"
    account_replication_type = "LRS"
    account_kind = "StorageV2" # terraform 

    static_website {
      index_document = "index.html"
    }
}

# Add index.html file
resource "azurerm_storage_blob" "blob" {
    name = "index.html"
    storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.storage_account.name
    storage_container_name = "$web" 
    type = "Block"
    content_type = "text/html"
    source_content = "<h1> Hello World, this is a website that was used to deploy terraform within azure </h1>"
}
```
### Deploying infrastructure to Azure & Backend

Within terminal, use the command, "terraform init"
![init](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1086819278965194792/1251611214794985513/image.png?ex=666f3547&is=666de3c7&hm=fcd1b58906343ff166ef6f758121e08defc8cbb47ef65e23859349601fc81812&)

``````python
az group create --name tf-state-rg --location eastus
``````
Then run to create the storage account, 

 ``````python
 az storage account create --name tftxsa1 --location eastus --resource-group tf-state-rg
 ``````

If the line of code dont work above with the error,

"(SubscriptionNotFound) Subscription XXXX-XXXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX was not found.
Code: SubscriptionNotFound
Message: Subscription XXXX-XXXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX was not found. "

The "Subscription not found" error usually occurs in Azure Site Recovery when the Azure subscription associated with the Azure Site Recovery service cannot be found or accessed.

![Resource_Provider](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1235529568056512553/1251655562157096970/f9b053d2-ebee-40cb-a59d-93420d028b7b.png?ex=666f5e94&is=666e0d14&hm=fff322930787207218b68d2ff5029b759534acda3063bc68e49436584311299b&)

Get Account Key, 

```ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group tf-state-rg --account-name tftxsa1 --query '[0].value' -o tsv)```

 Then to create the storage container, 

``` az storage container create --account-name tftxsa1 --name tfstatecon --public-access off --account-key $ACCOUNT_KEY```

---

- ### Part 2: Advanced Terraform Concepts & Variables
Setting Variables from Main.tf, create a variable.tf file and determine variables. 

``` variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure Region in which all resources in this project should be created."
}

variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account."
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
  description = "The name of the storage account to create."
}

variable "source_content" {
  description = "The content of the index.html file."
}

variable "index_document" {
  description = "The name of the index document."
} 
```
 After, give those variables values in a new file, dev.tfvars; 

 ``` 
 location = "eastus"
resource_group_name = "tf-state-rg"
storage_account_name = "terraformazurefaris01"
index_document = "index.html"
source_content = "<h1> Salute, this website is deployed using terraform."
``` 

So when we replace the variables in main.tf the code is cleaner. 

``` 
# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "tf-state-rg" {
    name = var.resource_group_name
    location = var.location
}

# Create a Storage Account
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_account" {
    name = var.storage_account_name
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.tf-state-rg.name
    account_tier ="Standard"
    location = var.location
    account_replication_type = "LRS"
    account_kind = "StorageV2"

    static_website {
      index_document = var.index_document
    }
}

# Add index.html file
resource "azurerm_storage_blob" "tfstatecon" {
    name = var.index_document
    storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.storage_account.name
    storage_container_name = "$web" 
    type = "Block"
    content_type = "text/html"
    source_content = var.source_content
``` 


- ### Alternative Path
- Upload terraform files into azure and init terraform, plan,

terrafrom apply 
enter values
accept actions: yes
